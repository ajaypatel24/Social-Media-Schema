The two indexes (plus one bonus) we created are the following.

1st index:

CREATE INDEX accountuser_firstname ON accountuser(first_name);

This creates an index on the table accountuser with the first name being the search key. This index is useful for options 2 and 4 in our application. In both options, we run a query to find all accountuser's with first_name = "name". By having this index, it'll help speed up this query.


2nd index:

CREATE INDEX post_user ON post(email);

This creates an index on the table post with the email being the search key. The email is a foreign key for the account user table. This index is useful for option 5 in our application where we search for the posts made by a user by name. Having an index for the posts made by a specific user would be helpful for this.


3rd index (bonus):

CREATE INDEX event_location_date ON event(location, date);

This creates an index on the table event with the location and date being the search keys. The data entries are first sorted by location, then by date. This index will allow users to browse what events are happening in their location on a said date and it'll make the search more efficient. This would be useful for future features of our application.
