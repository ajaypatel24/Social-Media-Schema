ERROR:  cannot update view "page_managers"
DETAIL:  views that do not select from a single table or view are not automatically updatable.
HINT:  To enable updating the view, provide an INSTEAD OF UPDATE trigger or an unconditional ON UPDATE DO INSTEAD rule.

What happens when you try to run SQL UPDATE on a view?
Here we see that the UPDATE clause works on the profitable_ads view but does not work on the page_managers view. From the error, in order to update a table directly through a view the view itself must only involve a single table. 
When views involve multiple tables they do not hold the actual data, they simply store a shorthand for a larger query. Running an UPDATE clause on a query has no effect, therefore views with multiple tables cannot be changed using UPDATE.
